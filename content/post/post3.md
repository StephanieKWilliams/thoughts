As a software engineer, writing clean and readable code is one of the most important practices you can adopt. Clean code not only makes your codebase more maintainable but also reduces technical debt and improves collaboration among team members. 

One of the best practices in software engineering is adhering to principles such as meaningful variable names, single-responsibility functions, and clear, concise comments. Clean code ensures that other developers (including your future self) can quickly understand the logic and purpose behind each line.

But writing clean code is only part of the equation. Code reviews are an equally important practice that allows your team to catch bugs, ensure best practices are followed, and share knowledge. Code reviews provide an opportunity for constructive feedback, fostering a learning culture within your team.

When conducting code reviews, it’s not just about pointing out mistakes—it’s about asking questions, suggesting improvements, and helping each other grow as developers. A positive code review culture promotes collaboration and ultimately leads to better software.
